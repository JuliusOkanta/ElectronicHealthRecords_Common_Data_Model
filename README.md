# üß¨ Multicentric COVID-19 Dataset Standardization with OMOP CDM

## üìñ Overview

This project focuses on integrating and standardizing multicentric observational healthcare data using the **OMOP Common Data Model (CDM)**. Data sources come from multiple hospitals and span several domains: diagnoses, medications, lab results, vital signs, and patient demographics.

By using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, the project harmonizes raw datasets into a unified, research-ready OMOP CDM format.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Domains

Each participating hospital provided data in the following categories:

- **Diagn√≥sticos** ‚Äì Diagnosis records  
- **Farmacos** ‚Äì Drug prescriptions  
- **Laboratorio** ‚Äì Lab test results  
- **Paciente** ‚Äì Demographic and mortality data  
- **Signos Vitales** ‚Äì Vital sign measurements  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All datasets were originally in **Catalan/Spanish**, requiring translation for mapping to OMOP CDM standards.

## üîÅ ETL Workflow

### 1. Data Profiling  
- Tool: **WhiteRabbit**  
- Output: `Scan_Report`  
- Goal: Analyze source tables and data distributions.

### 2. Mapping Specification  
- Tool: **Rabbit-In-A-Hat**  
- Purpose: Define mappings between source data and OMOP CDM tables/fields.  
- Output: Visual and tabular mapping specification.

### 3. Data Transformation & Loading  
- Platform: **MySQL Workbench**  
- Scripts:
  - [`OMOP_CDM_SCHEMA.sql`](OMOP_CDM_SCHEMA.sql) ‚Äì Creates OMOP CDM schema.
  - [`Consolidated_Dataset_Script.sql`](Consolidated_Dataset_Script.sql) ‚Äì Transforms and loads the data into OMOP tables.
